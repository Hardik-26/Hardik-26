I am currently a BCA student at Christ University(Central Campus), haven't found my niche in the I.T. industry yet.

Having been captivated by technology from an early age. My interest in programming was piqued at the age of 10 when I began experimenting with Scratch 2.0. Subsequently, I delved deeper into the realm of 1 and 0's.

In junior school, I opted for Information Technology (I.T.) as an additional subject and began crafting small games in "QBasic" purely for the sake of enjoyment. After completing my 10th-grade education, I was introduced to the Python programming language and its vibrant community. I diligently honed my skills in Python to such an extent that, at the age of 17, I successfully sold my first Python program.
A year later, I developed and launched my very own Python module. [![Scanny](https://badge.fury.io/py/scanny.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/scanny) .

This encapsulates my journey in the field of programming thus far.
